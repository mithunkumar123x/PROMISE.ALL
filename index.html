        Promise.all is useful in various scenarios where you need to handle multiple promises concurrently.<br> Here are a few examples:

Parallel API requests: When you need to make multiple API requests simultaneously, Promise.all allows you to initiate all the requests at once and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding.<br> This can be helpful in scenarios where you need to fetch data from multiple endpoints or perform multiple operations in parallel.<br>


Batch processing: If you have a large dataset that needs to be processed in batches, Promise.all can be used to process each batch concurrently. This can improve the overall performance and efficiency of your application.<br>

<br>Dependency resolution: In some cases, you may have multiple asynchronous operations that depend on the results of each other. Promise.all can be used to ensure that all the dependent promises are fulfilled before proceeding with the next steps. This is particularly useful when you have a chain of promises that need to be executed in a specific order.

<br>Data aggregation: When you have multiple promises that return data, Promise.all allows you to aggregate the results into a single array. This can be useful when you need to combine the data from different sources or perform calculations based on the results of multiple promises.

<br>Error handling: Promise.all simplifies error handling by rejecting the returned promise if any of the input promises is rejected. This allows you to handle errors in a centralized manner and take appropriate actions based on the outcome of all the promises.
